            <ol class="myol">
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef and pork. Use your hands
                    or a wooden spoon to mix until just combined.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, egg, flour, salt, black pepper,
                    nutmeg, and white pepper to the meat mixture. Mix until everything is well
                    incorporated.</li>
                <li>Cover the mixture with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30
                    minutes or overnight to allow the flavors to meld.
                <li>When you're ready to cook the meatballs, preheat your oven t
                    200°C/400°F.</li>
                <li>Use your hands or a spoon to shape the meat mixture into small balls,
                    about 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter. You should end up with around
                    20-25 meatballs.</li>
                <li>Place the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper,
                    leaving some space between each meatball to allow for even cooking.
                    <li>Dot the top of each meatball with butter.</li>
                <li>bake the meatballs in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until
                    they're cooked through and lightly browned.</li>
                <li> While the meatballs are baking, heat the beef broth in a large saucepan
                    over medium-low heat</li>
                <li>Once the meatballs are done, remove them from the oven and carefully
                    place them into the simmering beef broth</li>
                <li>Simmer the meatballs in the broth for about 5 minutes to coat them
                    evenly.</li>
                <li>If you want to add an extra layer of creaminess, stir in the heavy
                    cream.</li>
                <li>Serve the Swedish Meatballs hot with your choice of sides, such as Lingonberry jam or mashed potatoes!</li>
